# Joint_Savings
The objective of this excercise is to automate the creation of joint savings accounts, It is done by creating a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses which will control a joint savings account.
It uses ether management functions that enables depositing and withdrawing funds from the accounts.

It is done by following these 3 steps:
1) Creating  a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity
2) Compiling and deploying the Contract in the JavaScript VM
3) Interacting with the Deployed Contract

## Results
1) Testing setAccounts function:<br>
